# OSAL-like
OSAL is a good scheduler and Iâ€˜d like to try to re-build it and use it in future

#7th May 2016
Timer is added, however  the code is NOT debug yet. Please wait for the updating.

#4th May 2016
I have finished the basical parts of schudeler function, I use 3 tasks and set event to each others, it works. Also I add debug print MACROs with maybe useful. I will add software timer in next step.
